Validation of miRNA-guided cleavage_sites using PARE data

Require tools:
Jbrowse2 desktop(https://jbrowse.org/jb2/download/)

Require files:
1. Transcript.fasta and Transcript.fasta.fai (fai file can be created by samtool faidx).
2. 5'Ends signals of PARE in bigwig format(Transcriptome.bw) in transcrtipt coordinates (produced by 4.Quantification.sh).

Steps:
1. Get alignemnt between miRNA/sRNA and target of target site by predict tool or from miRNA target database.
2. Open JBrowse and key-in transcript id/target in search bar.
3. Open track pannel to add bigwig file(Transcriptome.bw) and display 5'Ends signals in transcrtipt coordinates.
4. Search sequence of target alignment by Jbrowse's function "sequence search".
5. Check whether there is the prominent peak at the middle of the alignemnt(target site) (see protocol Fig.7).
